This app allows users to browse sgRNA and associated data collected using our Glycogene CRISPR sgRNA library. To use:

·         * "Select Glycogene" using  drop-down menu

·         * “Select transcript (Ensembl)” as many genes have more than one protein-coding transcript variant. Information about sgRNA targeting the selected genes, location on transcript and experimental data regarding sgRNA enrichment/depletion will appear in table format. Here, enrichment/depletion provides log2-fold change data for genes with Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) FDR score <0.001 as described in ref. (1, 2).

 

To determine glycogenes appearing in selected, common cancer cell lines:

 * " ·         "Select tissue type"

·         * "Select cell line"

Data shown in rendered as heat maps using RSEM data collected from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (2).
